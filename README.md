# hello-world
*shimmer* *sparkle* *BOOM!*

I am the product of the human race and an unknown spiritual force(s). I wish to identify this force(s) an uncover the truth behind existence - including that of the Universe itself - while expressing my love for the human race through artistic demonstration.
I believe that Circles are everything, Creativity is power, and Friendship to be sacred.

I love books! Recommend me books!
